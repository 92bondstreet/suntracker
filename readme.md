Suntracker
=========

At each period of bad weather (rain, cold, cloud ...), I wonder all the time the same questions: 

> __Where is the fine weather?__ 

and especially 

> __Where is the sun?__ 


By applying __SunTracker__ you never lose track of the sun. In 3 clicks, __you retrieve the list of cities around you__ meet 
3 following criteria: 

- Your ideal temperature
- The maximum search distance around you.
- The type desired Weather


Screens
------------
The application SunTracker consists of 4 screens independent of each other. 


Screen 1 - Search
--------------------------

1. Top: local weather 
<br/>When the application is launched, __the local weather of your position is displayed__.

2. Centre: query
<br/>Then you can thanks to the 2 sliders: 
<br/>- __choose the ideal temperature minimum__ (between 32 and 122°F, configurable unit in options) 
<br/>- __choose the maximum distance from your location__ (between 1 and 1250miles, unit configurable in options)

3. Bottom: weather 
<br/>You could choose a type of weather: Only the cities with __the sun__ or cities __with any kind of weather__. 
<br/>According to the criteria used, the search may take several seconds.

The next screen shows the search with the following criteria: 

- NYC as a local position
- 50°F minimum

To __filter results__ you can specify in your search the following options: 

- The size of cities research in population.
- The number of results to display


Screen 3 - Top 25
--------------------------

Regardless of your research, you can always refer in real time the weather for 25 cities in the world's most liveable of the current month. 
Excellent to give you ideas for holiday.
